1. **Download the bundle** (available from releases or build locally):
   - `OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-CLI.exe` (232 MB) - Command-line interface
   - `OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-Web.exe` (236 MB) - Web interface

2. **Run immediately** - no installation, downloads, or setup required:
   ```bash
   # CLI Usage
   OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-CLI.exe recording.wav
   OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-CLI.exe recording.wav -model tiny -output transcript.txt
   
   # Web Interface
   OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-Web.exe
   # Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
   ```

**What's included in the bundle:**
- âœ… Whisper.cpp executable and all DLLs
- âœ… AI models (tiny and base) ready to use
- âœ… Web interface files
- âœ… All dependencies embedded

**Perfect for:**
- Sharing with colleagues who need immediate use

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Advanced Users)

### Option 2: Manual Setup (Advanced Users)

**For developers or users who want to customize models:**

#### 1. Download Required Files

**Download Whisper Executable:**
- Go to [Whisper.cpp Releases](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/releases)
- Download the appropriate version for your system
- Extract the executable to the OfflineTranscribe directory or subdirectory

**Supported locations for whisper executable:**
- `whisper.exe` or `whisper` (in main directory)
- `whisper-bin-x64/Release/whisper-cli.exe` (Windows build directory)
- `whisper-bin-x64/Release/main.exe` (Alternative Windows build)
- `bin/whisper.exe` or `bin/whisper` (bin subdirectory)

**Download Models:**
Run the included download script:
```bash
# Windows
download_models.bat

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x download_models.sh
./download_models.sh
```

Or download manually:
- [Tiny Model (~39 MB)](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-tiny.bin) - Fastest, least accurate
- [Base Model (~142 MB)](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-base.bin) - Good balance (recommended)
- [Small Model (~466 MB)](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-small.bin) - Better accuracy, slower
- [Medium Model (~1.5 GB)](https://huggingface.co/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/resolve/main/ggml-medium.bin) - Best accuracy, slowest

Save models in the `models/` directory.

#### 2. Usage

**Interactive Mode (Easiest):**
```bash
./OfflineTranscribe-cli.exe    # Windows
./OfflineTranscribe-cli        # Linux/Mac
```

**Command Line Mode:**
```bash
# Basic usage
./OfflineTranscribe-cli.exe recording.wav

# With options
./OfflineTranscribe-cli.exe recording.wav -model tiny -output transcript.txt
```

**Web Interface:**
```bash
./OfflineTranscribe-web.exe    # Windows
./OfflineTranscribe-web        # Linux/Mac
```
Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

## Command Line Options

- `-model <size>`: Model size (tiny, base, small, medium) - default: base
- `-output <file>`: Output file path - default: `<input>_transcription.txt`

## Output Format

**Sentence-level timestamps:**
```
[00:00:01.240 - 00:00:03.680] Hello there, this is a sample transcription.

[00:00:04.120 - 00:00:06.200] Each sentence has its own time range.
```

## Building Your Own Bundle

**To create self-contained executables with embedded dependencies:**

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21 or later
- Git

### Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd OfflineTranscribe

# Download dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build the self-contained bundle
./build_bundle.bat          # Windows
./build_bundle.sh           # Linux/Mac (coming soon)
```

This creates:
- `OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-CLI.exe` - Self-contained CLI
- `OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-Web.exe` - Self-contained web interface
- `dist/` folder with distribution files

### Manual Build (Advanced)
```bash
# Prepare resources
./prepare_bundle.bat

# Build regular versions
go build -o OfflineTranscribe-cli.exe cli.go whisper.go
go build -o OfflineTranscribe-web.exe web.go whisper.go

# Build self-contained versions
go build -o OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-CLI.exe cli.go whisper.go resources.go
go build -o OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-Web.exe web.go whisper.go resources.go

# Cross-platform builds
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-CLI-linux cli.go whisper.go resources.go
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-CLI-mac cli.go whisper.go resources.go
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bundle Version Issues

**"Failed to initialize resources"**
- The bundle executables are large (~230MB) and may take a moment to start
- Ensure you have sufficient disk space for temporary file extraction
- Check antivirus software isn't blocking execution

### Manual Setup Issues

**"whisper executable not found"**
- Download whisper.cpp from the releases page
- Place the executable in the OfflineTranscribe directory
- Ensure it's named `whisper.exe` (Windows) or `whisper` (Unix)

**"model file not found"**
- Run the download script: `download_models.bat` or `./download_models.sh`
- Or manually download models to the `models/` directory

### General Issues

**"transcription failed"**
- Check that your audio file is in a supported format
- Ensure the audio file isn't corrupted
- Try with a different model size

**Web interface not loading**
- Ensure port 8080 isn't blocked by firewall
- Try a different port: `./OfflineTranscribe-web.exe 3000`
- For bundle version: The web interface is embedded and extracted automatically

**Performance issues**
- Use smaller models for faster processing
- Convert audio to WAV format for best compatibility
- Use shorter audio segments (under 30 minutes) for better performance
- Close other applications to free up RAM when using larger models

## Distribution & Sharing

### Sharing the Bundle
The self-contained bundles are perfect for distribution:
- **Email**: Bundle files can be shared directly (note: large file size)
- **USB Drive**: Copy to portable drives for offline use
- **Network Share**: Place on shared folders for team access
- **Air-Gapped Systems**: Works without internet connectivity

### File Sizes
- `OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-CLI.exe`: ~232 MB
- `OfflineTranscribe-Bundle-Web.exe`: ~236 MB

Large sizes include:
- Complete Whisper AI models (142MB for base model)
- Whisper.cpp executable and all required libraries
- Web interface and runtime dependencies
